INTRODUCTION:

This is a converter for converting ANF(Algebraic Normal Form) to CNF(Conjuctive Normal Form) and vice-versa.
The converter is developed by Akshay Gupta . The output to anf-cnf converter is in standard DIMACS format.
To run the converter run the converter object file space fileaddress.
The format to input equations is given below:
	

SYNOPSIS:

./converter [FILEADDRESS]


FORMAT: 

Input Anf-Cnf:	The initial line starts with letter 'p' followed by space then number of variables.
Variables are to be represented by numbers instead of letters.
Each next line contains one eqaution. Xor's are to be represented by '|' and And's are to be represented by ','.
Each equation is terminated by '|t|'. The constant term in the equation are given at the beginning of the equation followed by '|'.

Example: Let the given equation be "0=a^b+c" , here '^' is AND and '+' is XOR. Now let variables a,b and c be represented by 1,2 and 3 respectivly.
Then the new equation is 0|1,2|3|t|. If there are no constants then follow the steps below:

Let the equation be "a=b^c+d"

Step 1: Replace variables by numbers, new equation is 1=2^3+4.
Step 2: Now on the XOR variable 1 on both sides, we get 1+1=2^3+4+1.
Step 3: 1+1=0, So we get the new equation is 0=2^3+4+1.
Step 4: The new equation in the required format is 0|2,3|4|1|t|.
